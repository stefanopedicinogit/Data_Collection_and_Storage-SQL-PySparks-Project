# Data_Collection_and_Storage-SQL-PySparks-Project
## Project description:
Working as an analyst for a new ride-sharing company. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides. Study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

N.B. This project was done in different parts. I didn't attached the SQL code used to retrieve data.
